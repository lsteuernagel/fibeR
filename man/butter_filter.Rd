\title{Passes signal through a zero-lag Butterworth filter from signal package.}
\usage{
butter_filter(
  input,
  extend_butter = 5000,
  w_butter = (1/50),
  order_butter = 2,
  filtertype = "low"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Numeric vector of the signal to be filtered}

\item{extend_butter}{Single Value. Extend vector at both ends by this length to get good filtering results. Should be large compared to vector length. Check by plotting the filtered result.}

\item{w_butter}{Single Value. Critical frequencies of the filter from signal::butter.}

\item{order_butter}{Single Value. Filter order of the filter from signal::butter. Defaults to 2.}

\item{filtertype}{Character. Type of the filter from signal::butter. Defaults to "low".}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of the filtered signal.
}
