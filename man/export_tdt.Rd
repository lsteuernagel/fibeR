\title{Extract fiber photometry from binary files using the TDT Matlab SDK}
\usage{
export_tdt(
  path,
  id,
  return_cached = TRUE,
  outputpath = tempdir(),
  matlab_path = "/beegfs/bin/matlab_2014b",
  export_full = FALSE,
  downsample_freq = 1000,
  channel_names = c("x465A", "x405A"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The full paths to the binary files}

\item{id}{The id that will be used to name the export file. Typically should be also in teh input file name but does not have to !}

\item{return_cached}{Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE will not run Matlab export if a '_export.txt' file with the provided id already exists in outputpath}

\item{outputpath}{Where to store the data. Defaults to temp dir of session}

\item{matlab_path}{The Matlab installaition on your system ! Defaults to the MPI beegfs one.}

\item{export_full}{Defaults to FALSE: Will downsample in matlab by taking the mean over downsample_freq data points. If TRUE: export every data point. This is much slower, because a much bigger files has to be written to disk from Matlab.}

\item{downsample_freq}{downsample in matlab by taking the mean over downsample_freq data points}

\item{channel_names}{the channel names in the TDT binary files (required by Matlab function). Default to "x465A","x405A"}

\item{verbose}{whether to print messages}
}
\value{
the file name of the exported data as a character string
}
\description{
Runs Matlab functions to export either all or downsampled data from the binary TDT files.
Requires a valid Matlab path !
