\title{Plot a heatmap of a data.frame that was created with \link[fibeR]{align_fibeR}}
\usage{
plot_heat_aligned_fibeR(
  aligned_fibeR,
  max_value_heat = 0.2,
  min_time = -1000,
  max_time = 4000,
  text_size_param = 15,
  heatmap_cols = c("#0072B2", "#ffffff", "#D55E00")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aligned_fibeR}{dataframe with aligned fiber photometry results and time integers as rownames}

\item{max_value_heat}{which value to cap heatmap at. Defaults to 0.2 (20\% dFF). Dependinng on the data to plots this should be adjusted.}

\item{min_time}{time to start heatmap (before intervention). useful when some samples are much longer than others}

\item{max_time}{time to end heatmap}

\item{text_size_param}{numeric to scale ggplot text size}

\item{heatmap_cols}{a cector with three colors that is passed to ggplot2::scale_fill_gradientn}
}
\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
Makes a heatmp plot
